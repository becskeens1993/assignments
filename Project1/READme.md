  I chose to design my portrait after this picture presented for a few reasons. I change quite a lot, seems like every year my personality changes. The woman in this image is named Lorrie and she quilted herself in a pixelated way. I believe since I change so much I should design my portrait similarly. I think pixels represent my change because the blurred look represents how I can't define myself to one self image.

  I made a pixaleted look by using the function rec(). I created multiple rectangles to fit perfectly within canvas on the webpage. With using rectangles I ended up using coordinates that had used the same numbers multple times, I chose to create variables to help my process. However, I didn't like how my canvas was centered at (0,0) so I centered the entire canvas then made sure that whatever screen size my webpage becomes my portrait would stay the same.
