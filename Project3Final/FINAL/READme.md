Personal Space


For my final project, I decided to update the first selfie assignment to better present my p5.js coding skills. This time, my inspiration did not come from another artist on how to portray how I view myself. Instead, I chose to try to draw a realistic portrait through coding of what I see when I look in the mirror. I have changed a lot since the first project and wanted to incorporate my mental health issues into this project, which is why I named it Personal Space. This project helped me take control of my current struggle of being touched without consent by giving me a healthy outlet to say NO to unwanted advances.
