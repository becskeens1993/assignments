The Black Plague!

I created this easy game featuring a rat from the medieval times trying to avoid catching the Black Plague. The Black Plague germ is bouncing around the screen as a black virus along with other friendly purple germs. In order to move our character, the rat, use the "a" key to move left and the "d" key to move right. Try your best to avoid the Black Plague virus from coming near your nose and below or you'll be frozen forever!!
